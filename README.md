This application is for the game - Tank Stars, created using LibGDX.
The game implements two-player (1 vs 1) game mode. The objective of the game is players having a face off on hilly 
terrain, taking turns firing bombs at one another. Players get a limited fuel ration per turn and are allowed to 
position themselves for a better shot. They can gain weapon upgrades by random airdrops, and must shoot 
at one another until one of their tanks is destroyed.
The basic functionality the game supports-
1) The player is allowed to select the power and angle of the trajectory and then fire the shot.
2) Players are allowed to choose from 3 tanks before starting the game. 
3) There is a pause menu that allows players to save or resume or exit to the main menu at any point in the game.
4) A player can save as well as load any saved game.
